                                       REST (Rough Ellipsoid Structure Tools)
**************************************************************************************

This is an upcoming tool to generate rough irregular structure from superellipsoids that can be used
in multiple areas of research like Astrophsics, Atmospheric physics, Nanoscience etc. The code is under 
development and will appear in this thread very soon. 

The code is under construction using Fortran, Python, VTK and Bash
